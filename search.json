Make an issue for that topic and assign yourself and another learner to review your contribution.\nMake a draft pull request to the lesson branch and ask the other learner assigned to review. Make changes until you’re both happy.\nMark the pull request as ready, and request the instructor to review.\nThe instructor reviews and merges the lesson branch when all contributions have been received.",
